# COLA Portfolio
## General Reflection
I am Dilan Karaguler, and I am PhD student in Mathematic at MSU. Attending COLA was a transformative experience for me, both professionally and personally.

The workshops provided through COLA were incredibly enriching, offering cutting-edge insights into education. These sessions equipped me with innovative strategies and tools to enhance my teaching practices, ensuring I can deliver high-quality, engaging, and effective online learning experiences to my students.

One of the most valuable aspects of the COLA experience was the opportunity to prepare and refine my teaching materials. This process allowed me to critically evaluate and improve my course content, ensuring it is accessible, inclusive, and pedagogically sound. I learned to incorporate various digital tools and platforms, making my teaching more interactive and dynamic.

Additionally, COLA played a crucial role in shaping my teaching philosophy. Through reflective exercises and discussions with peers and mentors, I gained deeper insights into my teaching values and beliefs. I now emphasize the importance of fostering an inclusive and supportive online learning environment, where students feel valued and motivated to engage deeply with the material.

The impact of COLA extended beyond immediate benefits. It also inspired me to consider attending the CCTI. The positive experience and the growth I achieved through COLA made me realize the value of continuous professional development and sparked my interest in further enhancing my teaching skills.
